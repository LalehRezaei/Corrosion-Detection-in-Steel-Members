# Corrosion-Detection-in-Steel-Members
 
This code creates a Streamlit web application for detecting corrosion in steel members using a pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model. The application processes uploaded images of steel members, identifies the corrosion regions, and classifies the images into predefined categories, providing the user with both the classification results and visual indications of the corroded areas. Below is a detailed explanation of each section of the code.
